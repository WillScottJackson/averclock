averclock
=========

Just an exercise in timers. Oh, it's an arduino-compatable clock.

1. Install [ino][1]
2. Run `deploy.sh`

No idea if it works on hardware yet. Requires a [Sparkfun SPI serial
display][2] connected to an Arduino Uno via SPI. SS on pin 10.

Time is automatically set from your computer's time when you upload the code.

`current_time.h` is automatically generated by `deploy.sh` so you must use
this.
